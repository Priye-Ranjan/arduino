Objective
The objective of the project is to develop an Automatic Engine Locking System Through
Alcohol Detection For Drunken Drivers, which will be convenient for use and better than the
previous version.

Introduction

India had earned the dubious distinction of having more number of fatalities due to road
accidents in the world. Road safety is emerging as a major social concern around the world
especially in India. Drinking and driving is already a serious public health problem, which is
likely to emerge as one of the most significant problems in the near future. The system
implemented by us aims at reducing the road accidents in the near future due to drunken driving.
The system detects the presence of alcohol in the vehicle and immediately locks the engine of the
vehicle. At the same time an SMS along with the location of the vehicle is send to three
pre-selected contacts. Hence the system reduces the quantum of road accidents and fatalities due
to drunk driving in future.
So the main purpose behind this project is “Drunk driving detection”. Now a days, many
accidents are happening because of the alcohol consumption of the driver or the person who is
driving the vehicle. Thus Drunk driving is a major reason of accidents in almost all countries all
over the world. Alcohol Detector in Car project is designed for the safety of the people seating
inside the car. This project should be fitted / installed inside the vehicle.
